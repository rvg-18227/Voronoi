## Installation

Requires **python3.9** or higher

Install simulator packages only

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install ffmpeg in the system to export videos

```
# ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macod
brew install ffmpeg
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

To generate the time lapse of the simulation, edit the run_and_render.sh file to add the necessary flags and run the command (ImageMagick needed):

```bash
bash run_and_render.sh
```

## Debugging

The code generates a `log/debug.log` (detailed), `log/results.log` (minimal) and `log\<player_name>.log` (logs from player) on every execution, detailing all the turns and steps in the game.
